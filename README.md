💼 OHS Incident Analytics Dashboard – Power BI


🧾 Client: King Size Construction Ltd.


📌 Project Title: Occupational Incident Analytics Dashboard – Trends, Risks & Costs



🏢 Company Overview
King Size Construction Ltd. is a leading Ghanaian construction firm known for delivering high-quality infrastructure, civil engineering, and real estate projects. With a workforce operating across diverse and often hazardous environments, the company prioritizes workplace safety and aims to minimize operational risks through data-driven decision-making.

📊 Project Overview
To improve health and safety oversight, this Power BI dashboard was developed to analyze over 700 simulated occupational incidents. It centralizes information on incident severity, causes, costs, job roles involved, PPE usage, and more—empowering the HSE team to take proactive measures.

🎯 Goal: Provide a real-time safety intelligence tool that enhances visibility, compliance, and strategic prevention efforts.

🎯 Project Objectives
Analyze injury trends over time and by job role

Identify high-risk areas and root causes

Compare safety compliance and cost implications

Optimize PPE policies and site supervision

Enable better response planning and awareness

📈 Dashboard Components & Analysis


🔹 1. Incident Severity by Year & Industry
Trends show fluctuating incident severity across Construction, Manufacturing, Mining, and Oil & Gas. Helps compare industry-specific risk levels.


🔹 2. Severity by Job Role
Top roles affected include:

Technicians

Electricians

Safety Officers

Welders

Machinists

Key for role-specific training and preventive strategies.


🔹 3. Injury Cause Distribution
The pie chart breaks down incidents by cause:

Chemical Exposure

Falls

Human Error

Fire

Equipment Malfunction

Highlights root causes that need process reviews and safety protocol updates.


🔹 4. Injury Type by Body Part & PPE Use
Explores which injury types (e.g., Burns, Fractures, Lacerations) affect which body parts, and how effective PPE was.

Drives insights into PPE quality and safety gear placement.


🔹 5. Cost Estimate by PPE Use & Severity
Fatal and major incidents without PPE have the highest cost impact


Highlights economic benefit of proper safety enforcement


🔹 6. Binary Filters (Interactive Buttons)
Enable root-cause slicing by:

Supervision (Yes/No)

Hazard Reported (Yes/No)

PPE Used (Yes/No)



📁 Dataset Overview
Mock dataset includes fields such as:

incident_date, industry, job_role, incident_severity,
