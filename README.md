💼 OHS Incident Analytics Dashboard – Power BI
📊 Overview
King Size Construction Ltd. is a leading Ghanaian construction company known for delivering major infrastructure, engineering, and real estate projects. Operating in hazardous environments, the company places high priority on workplace safety and operational risk reduction.

To support this mission, a Power BI dashboard was developed to analyze 700+ simulated incident records across sectors such as Construction, Mining, Manufacturing, and Oil & Gas. It provides real-time safety intelligence to help the Health, Safety & Environment (HSE) team make data-driven decisions.

🎯 Objectives
Monitor trends in workplace injuries by industry and role

Identify high-risk activities and root causes

Quantify the impact of PPE usage and supervision

Evaluate cost implications of safety non-compliance

Enhance training, PPE policy, and hazard response planning

🧩 Project Tasks & Features
✅ Severity & Risk by Industry and Year

Visualize annual incident trends by industry to understand sector-specific risk patterns.

📊 Incident Breakdown by Job Role

Spot top-affected roles (e.g., Technicians, Electricians, Welders) for targeted intervention.

🧪 Root Cause Insights

A pie chart highlights leading causes: Chemical Exposure, Falls, Human Error, Fire, and Equipment Failure.

🦺 Injury Types & Body Parts with PPE Use

Track what injuries (Burns, Fractures, Lacerations) occur, even when PPE is used. Breakdowns by body part provide actionable safety insight.

💰 Cost Analysis by PPE & Severity

Bar chart compares average costs of incidents with and without PPE. Fatal and major injuries without PPE are significantly more expensive.

🧩 Interactive Filters

Three binary slicers—Supervision, PPE Used, and Hazard Reported—enable deep dives into specific safety factors.

📁 Dataset
Simulated data fields:
incident_date, industry, job_role, incident_severity, incident_cause, ppe_used, body_part, injury_type, cost_estimate_usd, supervision, hazard_reported

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Power BI Desktop

Power Query for ETL (cleaning & transformation)

DAX for calculated fields (KPIs, cost modeling)

Excel for initial data formatting

💡 Challenges & Learnings
Designed flexible, reusable DAX measures for OHS KPIs

Balanced visual complexity with usability for field teams

Enhanced root-cause investigation with filter interactivity

Proved how supervision and PPE enforcement reduce incident cost
