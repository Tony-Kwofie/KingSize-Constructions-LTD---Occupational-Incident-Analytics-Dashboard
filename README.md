💼 Occupational Incident Analytics Dashboard – Power BI
🏗️ Client: King Size Construction Ltd.
Project Title: Occupational Incident Analytics Dashboard – Trends, Risks & Costs

🏢 Company Overview
King Size Construction Ltd. is a top-tier Ghanaian construction firm specializing in civil engineering and real estate projects. Due to the high-risk nature of their operations, they emphasize proactive occupational health and safety (OHS) practices to protect their workforce and reduce incident-related costs.

📊 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes 700+ simulated occupational incident records to uncover patterns in safety performance, injury types, root causes, and cost implications. It’s designed to support the HSE team with real-time safety intelligence to drive smarter, faster decisions.

Goal: Deliver a dynamic safety analytics tool that improves compliance, incident prevention, and cost control.

🎯 Key Objectives
Track incident trends across industries and job roles

Identify common injury causes and high-risk activities

Compare the cost impact of incidents with vs. without PPE

Support data-driven PPE procurement and safety training

Enable root cause exploration via interactive filters

📈 Dashboard Features
The dashboard is composed of six interactive sections:

🔹 1. Incident Severity by Year & Industry
Shows year-on-year trends segmented by Construction, Mining, Manufacturing, and Oil & Gas. Useful for benchmarking risk exposure.

🔹 2. Severity by Job Role
Highlights job roles with highest incident frequencies—Technicians, Electricians, and Welders stand out. Enables targeted safety programs.

🔹 3. Injury Causes
Pie chart analysis reveals top contributors: Chemical Exposure, Falls, and Human Error. These insights guide focused interventions.

🔹 4. Body Part, PPE Usage & Injury Type
Breaks down Burn, Fracture, Laceration, and Crush injuries by body part and PPE use. Provides clarity on injury patterns despite PPE compliance.

🔹 5. Cost by Severity & PPE
Bar chart proves that fatal/major incidents without PPE consistently result in higher costs—underscoring the ROI of proper PPE usage.

🔹 6. Smart Filters
Users can filter incidents by Supervision, PPE Usage, and Hazard Reporting to isolate contributing factors and compare scenarios.
