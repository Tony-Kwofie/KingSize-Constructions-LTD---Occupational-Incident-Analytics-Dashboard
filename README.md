💼 OHS Incident Analytics Dashboard – Power BI

Client: King Size Construction Ltd.

Project Title: Occupational Incident Analytics Dashboard – Trends, Risks & Costs

🏢 Company Overview
King Size Construction Ltd. is a leading Ghanaian construction firm known for delivering high-quality infrastructure, civil engineering, and real estate projects. With a workforce operating across diverse and often hazardous environments, the company prioritizes workplace safety and aims to minimize operational risks through data-driven decision-making.

📊 Project Overview
To improve health and safety oversight, this Power BI dashboard was developed to analyze over 700 simulated occupational incidents. It centralizes information on incident severity, causes, costs, job roles involved, PPE usage, and more—empowering the HSE team to take proactive measures.

Goal: Provide a real-time safety intelligence tool that enhances visibility, compliance, and strategic prevention efforts.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze injury trends over time and by role

Identify high-risk areas and root causes

Compare safety compliance and cost implications

Optimize PPE policies and site supervision

Enable better response planning and awareness

📈 Dashboard Analysis
This visual dashboard consists of six core components:

🔹 1. Incident Severity by Year & Industry
Trends show fluctuating incident severity across four industries, with Construction and Mining most affected. Useful for comparing risk exposure across sectors.

🔹 2. Severity by Job Role
Top roles affected include Technicians, Electricians, and Welders—essential for deploying targeted safety programs.

🔹 3. Injury Cause Distribution
The pie chart highlights Chemical Exposure, Human Error, and Falls as primary contributors. These insights drive training focus and procedural reforms.

🔹 4. Injury Type by Body Part & PPE Use
Drill-down visuals break down injuries (Burns, Fractures, Lacerations) by body part and PPE usage. Reveals which injuries still occur even with PPE, guiding procurement and policy updates.

🔹 5. Cost Estimate by PPE & Severity
Stacked column chart shows fatal and major incidents with no PPE consistently incur higher costs, justifying stronger PPE enforcement.

🔹 6. Binary Filters
Three quick filters—Supervision, Hazard Reported, and PPE Used—allow stakeholders to slice the data for root cause exploration.
